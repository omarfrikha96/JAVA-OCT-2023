###### Java is a statically-typed, high-level programming language that revolutionized the way languages were developed post-release. It’s provided complete support for cross-platform execution through its JVM system. Due to this, it’s widely adopted and has been going strong in the industry for 20+ years.
###### For the fact that it can run on almost every computer without changing behavior, as well as that its huge selection of libraries and tools, makes it the first choice of languages for many developers. It has also long been a mainstay of educational institutions due to the concepts it teaches and its interoperability between systems.
